## About Me

I am a student at Flinders University, currently completing my Bachelor of Computer Science.

I enjoy learning about software engineering across the full stack. From designing reliable backend systems, modeling clean and scalable databases, and optimizing performance. At the same time, I have a strong interest in frontend development and building intuitive, responsive user interfaces that are enjoyable to use but with a line of ease of functionality.
